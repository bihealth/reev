Pathogenic Very Strong
======================

PVS1 (null variant)
-------------------

- variant is a null variant (sequence ontology: ``stop_gained``, ``frameshift_variant``, ``splice_acceptor_variant``, ``splice_donor_variant``, ``start_lost``, ``exon_loss_variant``, ``transcript_variant``)
- loss of function is a known disease mechanism for the affected
- incorporate figures 4-5 from Walker et al. (2023)

**Caveats**

- beware of genes where LOF is not a known disease mechanism (e.g., GFAP, MYH7)
- caution when interpreting LOF at the extreme 3' and of gene
- caution with splice variants predicted to lead to exon skipping but leave the remainder of the protein intact
- caution in the presence of multiple transcripts


PVS1 Update 2018
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Decision Tree**

In Tayoun et al. (2018), the following decision tree is defined.
It is based on the assumption that the gene-disease association is at a moderate, strong, or definitive clinical level according to Strande et al. (2017).
Note that we do not incorporate the matching by Strande et al. (2017) for now.

And here is the tree as an image:

.. image:: img/Tayoun-2018-Figure-1.png
    :alt: Figure 1 from Tayoun et al. (2018)

**Notes**

- criterion (2) ``splice_acceptor_variant`` or ``splice_donor_variant`` is mutually exclusive to splice site prediction
- "Generally, NMD is not predicted to occur if the premature termination codon occurs in the 3' most exon or within the 3' most 50 nucleotides of the penultimate exon" -- from Tayoun et al. (2018)

**Criteria for LoF Disease Mechanism**

Further, Tayoun et al. (2018) define the following criteria for a loss-of-function disease mechanism.

1. Follow PVS1 decision tree if:
    - clinical validaity classification of gene is strong or definite AND
    - >=3 LoF functions are Pathogenic without PVS1 AND
    - >10% of variants associated with the phenotype are LoF (must be across more than 1 exon - except for single-exon genes)
2. Decrease final strenght by **one** level (IOW: to ``PVS1_Strong``) if:
    - clinical validity classification of gene is at least moderate AND
    - >=2 LoF variants have previously associated with the phenotype (must be across more than one exon - except for single-exon genes) AND
    - null mouse model recapitulates disease phenotype
3. Decrease final strength by **two** levels (IOW: to ``PVS1_Moderate``) if:
    - clinical validity classification of gene is at least moderate AND EITHER
        - >=2 LoF variants have been previously associated with the phenotype (must be across more than one exon - except for single-exon genes) OR
        - null mouse model recapitulates disease phenotype
4. If there is no evidence that LoF variants cause disease, PVS1 should not be applied at any strength level.

Pathogenic Strong
=================

PS1 (same amino acid change)
----------------------------

- same amino acid change has previoulsy been established as pathogenic, regardless of nucleotide change
- for splicing variants, Tables 2-3 from Walker et al. (2023) shall be used

**Table 2 Rules** from Walker et al. (2023) of Variant under assessment (VUA)

- VUA located outside splice donor / acceptor +/- 1/2 dinucleotide positions
    - baseline computational code: PP3
        - position of comparison variant relative to VUA: same nucleotide
            - with P comparison variant: PS1
            - with LP comparison variant: PS1_Moderate
        - position of comparison variant relative to VUA: within same splice donor / acceptor motif (including +/- 1/2 position)
            - with P comparison variant: PS1_Moderate
            - with LP comparison variant: PS1_Supporting
- VUA located at splice donor / acceptor +/- 1/2 dinucleotide positions
    - baseline computational code: PVS1
        - position of comparison variant relative to VUA: within same splice donor / acceptor +/- 1/2 dinicleotide
        - with P comparison variant: VUA is PS1_Supporting
        - with LP comparison variant: N/A
    - baseline computational code: PVS1
        - position of comparison variant relative to VUA: within same splice donor / acceptor region but outside +/- 1/2 dinicleotide
        - with P comparison variant: VUA is PS1_Supporting
        - with LP comparison variant: VUA is PS1_Supporting
    - baseline computational code: PVS1_Strong, PVS1_Moderate, PVS1_Supporting
        - position of comparison variant relative to VUA: within same splice donor / acceptor +/- 1/2 dinicleotide
        - with P comparison variant: VUA is PS1
        - with LP comparison variant: VUA is N/A
    - baseline computational code: PVS1_Strong, PVS1_Moderate, PVS1_Supporting
        - position of comparison variant relative to VUA: within same splice donor / acceptor motify but outside +/- 1/2 dinicleotide
        - with P comparison variant: VUA is PS1_Moderate
        - with LP comparison variant: VUA is PS1_Supporting

.. image:: img/Walker-2023-Table-2.png
    :alt: Table 2 from Walker et al. (2023)

**Caveats**

- beware of changes that impact splicing rather than amino acid or protein level

**Notes**

- incorporation of splicing here is based on the recommendation by Walker et al. (2023)

PS2 (confirmed *de novo*)
-------------------------

- confirmed *de novo* variant in a patient withou disease and no family history

**Caveats**

- confirmation of paternity only is insufficient (egg donation, surrogate motherhood, errors in embryo transfer, ... can contribute to nonmaternity)

**Notes**

- ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation Work Group (2021) describe a point-scale for PS2 and PM6.
  However, this is hard to apply automatically as it requires an assessment of whether the phenotype is highly specific or consistent with the gene.

PS3 (functional studies)
------------------------

- well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product

**Caveats**

- functional studies that have been validated and shown to be reproducible and robust in a clinical diagnostic laboratory setting are considered the most well established

**Notes**

- There is further guidance in Brnich et al. (2020) on how to apply PS3 and BS3 when interpreting "well-established" functional assays.
- However, as this process is manual, it is not further considered here.
- Walker et al. (2023) is not considered here as the authors recommend to capture experimental evidence with PVS1 and is not suitable for automatic classification.

PS4 (prevalence)
----------------

- prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared with the prevalence in controls

**Caveats**

- relative risk or OR, as obtained from case–control studies, is >5.0, and the confidence interval around the estimate of relative risk or OR does not include 1.0.
  See Richards et al. (2015) for detailed guidance.
- in instances of very rare variants where case–control studies may not reach statistical significance, the prior observation of the variant in multiple unrelated patients with the same phenotype, and its absence in controls, may be used as moderate level of evidence.

Pathogenic Moderate
===================

PM1 (hotspot)
-------------

- located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g., active site of an enzyme) without benign variation

**Caveats**

- Pejaver et al. (2022) suggest to limit combined evidence from P1 and PP3 to strong

PM3 (recessive and in trans)
----------------------------

- for recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in an affected patient

According to ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation Work Group (2019), there are points awarded per in *trans* proband (all variants should be sufficiently rare, thus meet PM specifiacation, P-Pathogenic or LP-Likely pathogenic):

.. list-table:: Points per proband

    * - Classification / zygosity of other variant
      - Points per confirmed in *trans*
      - Points if phase unknown
    * - Pathogenic or Likely pathogenic variant
      - 1.0
      - 0.5(P) or 0.25(LP)
    * - Homozygous occurence (max point 1.0)
      - 0.5
      - N/A
    * - Uncertain significance variant
      - 0.25
      - 0.0

The resulting point rating gives the following evidence strength for PM3:

- 0.5-1.0: PM3_Supporting
- 1.0-2.0: PM3
- 2.0-4.0: PM3_Strong
- >=4.0: PM3_VeryStrong

**Notes**

- ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation Work Group (2019) changes this from "for recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic" to "for recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in an affected patient"
- Further, this document introduces the point-based system from above.
- There are further considerations in ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation Work Group (2019) that are not considered here.

PM4 (protein length)
--------------------

- protein length changes as a result of in-frame deletions/insertions in a nonrepeat region or stop-loss variants

PM5 (overlapping missense)
--------------------------

- n ovel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has been seen before

**Caveats**

- beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.


PM6 (assumed *de novo*)
-----------------------

- assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity

Pathogenic Supporting
=====================

PM2_Supporting (absent from controls)
-------------------------------------

- absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) in gnomAD

**Notes**

- population indel data is of high quality by now
- ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation Work Group (2020) has downgraded this to PM2_Supporting by default.

PP1 (cosegregaton)
------------------

- cosegregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause th disease

**Notes**

- may be used as stronger evidence with increasing segregation data

PP2 (missense)
--------------

- missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and in which missense variants are a common mechanism of disease

PP3 (*in silico* predictions)
-----------------------------

- multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.)
- incorporate figures 4-5 from Walker et al. (2023)

.. image:: img/Walker-2023-Figure-5.png
    :alt: Figure 5 from Walker et al. (2023)

**Caveats**

- because many in silico algorithms use the same or very similar input for their predictions, each algorithm should not be counted as an independent criterion.
  PP3 can be used only once in any evaluation of a variant.
- Pejaver et al. (2022) suggest to limit combined evidence from P1 and PP3 to strong.

**Notes**

- The resulting class is updated according to the Pejaver et al. (2022).
  Note that it would be very useful to run the original code by Pejaver with more scores.
  The code from Pejaver `can be found here on GitHub <https://github.com/vpejaver/clingen-svi-comp_calibration>`__.

PP4 (monogenetic)
-----------------

- patient's phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology

PP5 (reputable source)
----------------------

*Remove according to Biesecker et al. (2018).*

Benign Standalone
=================

BA1 (5% frequency)
------------------

- allele frequency is >5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium

In accordance with Ghosh et al. (2018), there is a list of exceptions from this rule with high MAF but **some** evidence for pathogenicity.

Benign Very Strong
==================

This category does not exist in Richards et al. (2015) but is implicitely introduced by Tavtigian et al. (2020).

Benign Strong
=============

BS1 (expected frequency)
------------------------

- allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder

BS2 (healthy adult)
-------------------

- observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age

BS3 (functional studies)
------------------------

- well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies show no damaging effect on protein function or splicing

**Notes**

- There is further guidance in Brnich et al. (2020) on how to apply PS3 and BS3 when interpreting "well-established" functional assays.
  However, as this process is manual, it is not further considered here.
- Walker et al. (2023) is not considered here as the authors recommend to capture experimental evidence with PVS1 and is not suitable for automatic classification.

BS4 (lack of segregation)
-------------------------

- lack of segregation in affected members of a family

**Caveat**

- presence of phenocopies for common phenotypes (i.e., cancer, epilepsy) can mimic lack of segregation among affected individuals
- families may have more than one pathogenic variant contributing to an autosomal dominant disorder, further confounding an apparent lack of segregation

Benign Moderate
===============

This category does not exist in Richards et al. (2015) but is implicitely introduced by Tavtigian et al. (2020).

Benign Supporting
=================

BP1 (missense)
--------------

- missense variant in a gene for which primarily truncating variants are known to cause disease

BP2 (in trans)
--------------

- Observed in trans with a pathogenic variant for a fully penetrant dominant gene/disorder or observed in cis with a pathogenic variant in any inheritance pattern

BP3 (in-frame in repetitive)
----------------------------

- in-frame deletions/insertions in a repetitive region without a known function

BP4 (*in silico* predictions)
-----------------------------

- multiple lines of computational evidence suggest no impact on gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.)
- incorporate figures 4-5 from Walker et al. (2023)

**Caveats**

- because many in silico algorithms use the same or very similar input for their predictions, each algorithm cannot be counted as an independent criterion. BP4 can be used only once in any evaluation of a variant.

**Notes**

- The resulting class is updated according to the Pejaver et al. (2022).
  Note that it would be very useful to run the original code by Pejaver with more scores.
  The code from Pejaver `can be found here on GitHub <https://github.com/vpejaver/clingen-svi-comp_calibration>`__.

BP5 (found in solved)
---------------------

- variant found in a case with an alternate molecular basis for disease

BP6 (reputable source)
----------------------

*Remove according to Biesecker et al. (2018).*

BP7 (synonymous)
----------------

- synonymous (silent) variant for which splicing prediction algorithms predict no impact to the splice consensus sequence nor the creation of a new splice site AND the nucleotide is not highly conserved
- incorporate figures 4-5 from Walker et al. (2023)

ACMG 2015 Rules
===============

The following rules have been defined in Richards et al. (2015).

Pathogenic
----------

If one of the following criteria 1-3 are fulfilled.

1. 1 very strong (PVS1) AND one of the following
    a. >=1 strong (PS1-PS4)
    b. >=2 moderate (PM1-PM6)
    c. >=1 moderate (PM1-PM6) AND >=1 supporting (PP1-PP5)
    d. >=2 supporting (PP1-PP5)
2. >=2 strong (PS1-PS4)
3. 1 strong (PS1-PS4) AND
    a. >=3 moderate (PM1-PM6)
    b. 2 modreate (PM1-PM6) AND >=2 supporting (PP1-PP5)
    c. 1 moderate (PM1-PM6) AND >=4 supporting (PP1-PP5)

Likely Pathogenic
-----------------

If one of the following criteria 1-7 are fulfilled.

1. 1 very strong (PVS1) AND 1 moderate (PM1-PM6)
2. 1 strong (Ps1-PS4) AND 1-2 moderate (PM1-PM6)
3. 1 strong (PS1-PS4) AND >=2 supporting (PP1-PP5)

------

If one of the following criteria 1-2 are fulfilled.

1. 1 standalone (BA1)
2. >=2 strong (BS1-BS4)

Likely Benign
-------------

If one of the following criteria 1-2 are fulfilled.

1. 1 strong (BS1-BS4) AND 1 supporting (BP1-BP7)
2. >=2 supporting (BP1-BP7)

Uncertain Significance
----------------------

If if one of the following criteria 1-2 are fulfilled.

1. Other criteria shown above are not met
2. the criteria for benign and pathogenic are contradictory

ACGS 2020 Rules
===============

The following is a refinement of the rules above set by the Ellard et al. (2020).

Pathogenic
----------

1. 1 very strong (PVS) AND one of the following
    a. >=1 strong
    b. >=1 moderate
    c. >=2 supporting
2. >=3 strong
3. 2 strong AND one of the following
    a. >=1 moderate
    b. >=2 supporting
4. 1 strong AND one of the following
    a. >=3 moderate
    b. >=2 moderate AND >=2 supporting
    c. >=1 moderate AND >=4 supporting

Likely Pathogenic
-----------------


1. >=2 strong
2. 1 strong AND one of teh following
    a. 1-2 moderate OR
    b. >=2 supporting
3. >=3 moderate OR
    a. 2 moderate AND >=2 supporting
    b. 1 modereate AND >=4 supporting

Tavtigian et al. 2020 Rules
===========================

Alternatively, Tavtigian et al. (2020) formulated the rules as an integer point system.

Table 2 from this manuscript gives point values

.. list-table:: Points per proband

    * - evidence strength
      - points pathogenic
      - points benign
    * - indeterminate
      - 0
      - 0
    * - supporting
      - 1
      - -1
    * - moderate
      - 2
      - -2
    * - strong
      - 4
      - -4
    * - very strong
      - 8
      - -8

The point-based variant classification categories are then given in Table 3

.. list-table:: Categories and point ranges

    * - category
      - point ranges
    * - pathogenic
      - >= 10
    * - likely pathogenic
      - 6 to 9
    * - uncertain significance
      - 0 to 5
    * - likely benign
      - -1 to -6
    * - benign
      - <= -7

VUS Heat
========

Ellard et al. (2020) describe a "heat range" for VUS.

1. hot - one of
    a. 1 strong + 1 supporting
    b. 2 moderate + 1 supporting
    c. 1 moderate + 3 supporting
2. warm, one of
    a. 1 strong
    b. 2 moderate
    c. 1 moderate + 2 supporting
    d. 4 supporting
3. tepid, one of
    a. 1 moderate + 1 supporting
    b. 3 supporting
4. cool, one of
    a. 1 moderate
    b. 2 supporting
5. cold
    a. 1 supporting
6. ice cold -- otherwise


------------------------------
Code Modification Nomenclature
------------------------------

In accordance with ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation Work Group (2017), modification codes are used.
That is, for a criterion ``${CRIT}``, the modification codes ``${CRIT}_Supporting``, ``${CRIT}_Moderate``, ``${CRIT}_Strong``, ``${CRIT}_VeryStrong``.
