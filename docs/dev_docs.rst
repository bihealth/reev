.. admonition:: Developer or User?

    This section is part of the instrutions for programmers interested in REEV.
    If you want to **use** REEV, the best place is to start at :ref:`doc_quickstart`.

Documentation is maintained in the ``docs/`` directory using Sphinx.
It is automatically built to `reev.readthedocs.io <https://reev.readthedocs.io/>`__.
