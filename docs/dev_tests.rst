.. admonition:: Developer or User?

    This section is part of the instrutions for programmers interested in REEV.
    If you want to **use** REEV, the best place is to start at :ref:`doc_quickstart`.

Tests can be run with ``make test`` (or ``make -C backend/frontend test``).

We use Pytest for testing the backend and Vitest for the frontend.
